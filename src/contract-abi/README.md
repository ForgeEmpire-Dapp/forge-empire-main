# Contract ABIs

This directory contains contract ABI files for the application.

## Structure
- Each contract ABI should be stored as a separate JSON file
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `XPEngine.json`, `SocialGraph.json`)
- Maintain consistent formatting for easy reading

## Usage
These ABI files are imported and used by the frontend hooks and components for contract interactions.
